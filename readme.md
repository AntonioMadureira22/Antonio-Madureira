# Hello Everyone!
## Thank you for taking the time in looking at my project. I was given the task in creating a portfolio for myself. This is to show off all my work and progess thus far. I was given instructions to making the page acessible, be semantic, and look somewhat like the moc "gif" that was presented. I tried my best in doing to my knowledge in skill. That being said I know my product is no where near the moc "gif". I need to work better on my skills with css & html a bit more. This won't stop me as I am dertermined to be proficient at these languages.
